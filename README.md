# File Structure and explanation
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used Tkinter package to design all the pages used in this application. This application requires a username and password to log in. You can either login as doctor or as patient. If you login as doctor you can set available timings, patient list who made appointment
and send medical report of the patient to their registered email as mail. When you login as patient, you can choose available timing of doctor, enter patient details and make an appointment. We used 'localhost' mysql server for database.

# Points to note:
- This might not be a full-fledged project.
- It can be extendable if needed.
- Since we have converted this into an exe file, this can be used without having the python interpreter.
- If you need to know about how every sector works in this application, you might need a python interpreter and the required modules (mentioned in requirements.txt).
- This can only work in an environment with mysql server (local or remote).
- Also we have given static values in database as it is for developemnt purpose. Database creation also need to be done manually with specific filled values.
